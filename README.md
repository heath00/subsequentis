# subsequentis
<i>subsequentis</i> is an autonomous robot that was built for the 2016 Northwestern University Design Competition. It won the first place prize out of ten teams for the competition by knocking a cup off of a manually controlled robot with a retroreflective cup on top faster than its opponents for 7 rounds. All of the actual code that was run on the day of the competition can be found in tests/findCup.
